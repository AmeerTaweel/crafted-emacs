;;; example-config.el -- Example Crafted Emacs user customization file -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Crafted Emacs supports user customization through a `config.el' file
;; similar to this one.  You can copy this file as `config.el' to your
;; Crafted Emacs configuration directory as an example.
;;
;; In your configuration you can set any Emacs configuration variable, face
;; attributes, themes, etc as you normally would.
;;
;; See the README.org file in this repository for additional information.

;;; Code:
;; At the moment, Crafted Emacs offers the following modules.
;; Comment out everything you don't want to use.
;; At the very least, you should decide whether or not you want to use
;; evil-mode, as it will greatly change how you interact with Emacs.
;; So, if you prefer Vim-style keybindings over vanilla Emacs keybindings
;; remove the comment in the line about `crafted-evil' below.
